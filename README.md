# EZ-IW4MAdmin-DBViewer

#### A simple collecton of Python3 Scripts that allow you to export your entire IW4MAdmin Database and view it in an easy fashion. While it is possible to read `IW4NAdmin\Database\Database.db`, there are many constraints/links that make viewing the default database *extremely* difficult.

* Usage: python combine_db.py
